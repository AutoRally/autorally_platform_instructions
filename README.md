# AutoRally Platform Instructions

The documents contained in this repository provide all of the information required to contruct a complete AutoRally platform. The platform is made of two primary parts, the chassis and compute box.

![alt text][note] We are actively developing these documents and files so they will change frequently and should be used for reference only. If you plan to build your own platform, please wait until this note is removed to actually purchase any parts.

## Getting Started

Look though the documentation and [Download](https://github.com/AutoRally/autorally_platform_instructions/archive/master.zip) a copy if you want. Look over the Getting Started section in the chassis and compute box instruction documents, followed by the parts list and the operating procedures to get a sense of the build process, skill requirements, fabriation methods, and testin gprocedures. The AutoRally platform can be fabricated by a small team (2-3 students) of non-professionals. The build will go most smoothly if there is at least one person on the team familiar with basic soldering, 3D printing, Ubuntu and ROS configuration. We also link to tutorials for all of the skills required, so any interested party can easily acquire them.

![alt text][note]  The most difficult component to fabricate is the compute box enclosure, which may require sending away to a local sheet metal fabrication shop if sheet metal fabrication experience and tools are not available.

## Included Files:

### AutoRally_Chassis_Instructions

Complete instructions to build an AutoRally chassis.

### AutoRally_Compute_Box_Instructions (coming soon)

Complete instructions to build a Mini-ITX AutoRally compute box.

### AutoRally_Operating_Procedures (coming soon)

Document outlining pre-run preparations, how to configure a system for testing, and post-run procedures. The system configuration covers setting up and powering the platform and control station. Software startup instructions are found on the [AutoRally wiki](https://github.com/AutoRally/autorally/wiki).

### models/

CAD models for components to be fabricated (most will be 3D printed).

### AutoRallyPartsList

![alt text][note]  A stable parts list will be available over summer 2016, the current parts list is available mostly for reference as we finish the platform documentation.

Spreadsheet of all parts required to build an AutoRally Platform. The document includes the estimated price, quantities, and link to purchase each component.

To purchase platform parts, order the entire parts list in the indicated quantities. The list includes the required parts, parts that help with usability (spare set of batteries), and some common maintenance items. Parts are organized by supplier and color-coded based on if the part is used in the chasssis or compute box. Normally, all the parts take around 2 weeks to arrive.

![alt text][note]  The platform uses parts from about 25 suppliers.

![alt text][note]  Review the entire list before making any purchases as you may already have some of the parts around such as computer monitors, spare laptops for use as ground station, assorted cables, keyboard and mouse, tools, and supplies.
